## üí° Notes on Staking

- Staking is **not tied to nodes**; it is a **protocol-wide liquidity signal**.
- Tokens staked are used to provide liquidity for swaps and **earn protocol-defined fees**.
- Highly inflationary tokens may face low voluntary staking participation.
- **Token authorities** may mint and stake reserves to ensure minimum liquidity.
- Staking is also used as a **monetary velocity throttle**, replacing interest rate levers.
- Protocol enforces that **staked funds cannot be transferred** until unstaked.

## üîê Security and Enforcement

All methods automatically enforce:
- Attestation validity (`attestor_id` whitelisted)
- Jurisdictional compliance
- Sanctions list checks against (`attestor_id`, `attestation_id`)

Wallets without valid attestations cannot participate in transfers or staking.
