# Deployment Requirements for the Digital USD Protocol

This document outlines the technical, operational, and institutional resources required to deploy the Digital USD settlement protocol at national scale. It assumes a full replacement of legacy interbank settlement systems (Fedwire, ACH) with a decentralized, attestation-based token infrastructure governed by the U.S. Treasury and supported by a validator network.

---

## 1. Protocol Engineering Team
- Core protocol developers
- Ledger logic and consensus implementation
- Wallet creation and attestation enforcement
- Network ops and validator node orchestration
- Cryptography experts (QR-cash, tamper-evidence, signatures)
- QA, simulation, and stress testing

## 2. SDK and Tooling Team
- Language-specific SDKs (TypeScript, Java, Python, Swift, Kotlin)
- Wallet SDKs with attestation, denylist enforcement, staking, and swap support
- Documentation and reference integrations
- Testnet and sandbox environments

## 3. Integration Coordination Teams

### A. Payments Ecosystem
- ACH originators (payroll processors, payment providers)
- Fedwire endpoints (banks, settlement hubs)
- Card networks (for interoperability bridging)
- Point-of-sale and merchant hardware/software vendors

### B. Bank Integration
- Coordination with ~4,000–5,000 U.S. banks holding Fed reserves
- Custodial wallet onboarding and reconciliation systems
- Internal system mapping to synthetic balance models
- Legal/compliance liaison support for onboarding

## 4. U.S. Treasury Implementation Team
- Sanctions enforcement and denylist infrastructure
- Attestor certification and monitoring
- Public attestation lookup APIs
- QR-cash design and distribution coordination

## 5. Federal Reserve Token Authority Team
- Token issuance governance and mint authorization logic
- Implementation of monetary policy via staking yields
- Emergency response protocols and monetary backstops
- Participation in protocol governance and upgrades

## 6. Regulatory Coordination Team
- Liaison roles with:
  - Federal Reserve Board of Governors
  - OCC, FDIC, CFPB, FinCEN
  - Congressional oversight (as needed)
- Legal carve-out and amendment work
- Elimination of duplicative compliance burdens

## 7. Security, Audit, and Privacy Infrastructure
- Formal verification of ledger rules
- Network security and validator hardening
- Red-team adversarial testing
- Audit and forensic support tooling
- Attestation fraud handling and dispute resolution

## 8. Communications and Adoption Strategy
- Bank and fintech onboarding campaigns
- Public wallet and QR-cash usage education
- Legal and regulatory explainer materials
- Messaging around compliance, privacy, and accountability

## Optional but Recommended
- Academic and technical advisory group
- Disaster recovery and monetary continuity simulations
- International outreach for FX and cross-border adoption

## Summary
This deployment spans cryptographic engineering, legal infrastructure, bank coordination, and policy design. With focused leadership and institutional buy-in, a national rollout of the Digital USD protocol could be achieved within 18–36 months.
