# ðŸ’µ QR Code Cash

## 1. Tamper-Evident Tear-Open QR Code Cash

- Physical bills are printed by the U.S. Treasury and each corresponds to a **unique wallet** containing a fixed amount of digital USD tokens.
- Each note has a **tamper-evident seal** hiding the **private key**, and a **visible QR code** showing the public wallet address.
- These notes **function exactly like physical cash**: whoever possesses the paper, possesses the funds.

## 3. Treasury-Managed Issuance

- The U.S. Treasury creates a new wallet for every note printed.
- The treasury creates a unique wallet containing digital USD tokens in advance.
- The private key is printed and sealed inside the note at the time of issuance.
- Denominations are fixed and printed directly on the note (e.g., $1, $5, $20).
- Treasury can actually see exactly how much cash exists

## 4. Usage Behavior

- **Spending** a note does *not* require opening it.
- The bearer physically hands the note to the recipient, just like cash.
- **Transferring** the funds to a digital wallet **does** require opening the seal and scanning the private key.
- Once opened, the note is considered void for further physical transfer, as its private key is exposed.

## 5. Offline Utility and Finality

- Notes enable **offline peer-to-peer payments**, disaster recovery, and unbanked commerce.
- Value is **inherent to the physical item**, similar to bearer instruments.
- Finality is physical until the wallet is drained or the note is opened.

## 6. Anti-Fraud and Verification

- Public QR code allows anyone to verify the balance of a note in real time.
- Scanning the public key reveals:
  - Amount
  - Status (unspent/spent)
  - Wallet history (if transferred digitally)
- Tamper-evident seals prevent covert access to the private key.

## 7. Bill Format and Print Specifications

- Standard U.S. bill size (156mm x 66mm)
- Public QR (wallet address) printed visibly
- Private key hidden under **tamper-evident tear seal**
- Paper composition similar to cotton-linen cash

## 8. Treasury Workflow

- Each note corresponds to a unique wallet
- Treasury creates a unique wallet at print time and **does not store private keys**
- Printed denomination matches wallet balance
- Enables precise public tracking of all outstanding cash inventory

## 9. Lifecycle

- An **unopened note** can be handed off as cash and retains its bearer-value characteristics.
- An **opened note** allows the recipient to digitally redeem the tokens, after which the physical note is void.
- Anyone can scan the public QR to check its balance at any time.
