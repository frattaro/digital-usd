# White Paper: A New Settlement Layer for the Digital Age

## Executive Summary

This protocol replaces legacy financial infrastructure (Fedwire, ACH) with a decentralized, programmable, and compliance-first settlement system. It supports real-time transfers, protocol-level regulatory enforcement, and multi-token monetary issuance with transparent policy mechanics.

## System Overview

The protocol introduces:

- Direct wallet custody with KYC attestation
- Transparent monetary policy via staking and yield curves
- Protocol-level enforcement of compliance (sanctions, court freezes)
- Multi-token issuance and programmable monetary rules
- Interoperability with physical bearer cash (QR Notes)
- Open, auditable transaction ledger with selective pseudonymity

Each component is designed to operate independently while integrating within a unified compliance and settlement framework.

## 1. Replace Fedwire and ACH

Legacy U.S. settlement systems (Fedwire, ACH) are replaced by a real-time, decentralized infrastructure that preserves auditability and legal compliance while increasing throughput and programmability.

## 2. Protocol-Level Compliance

Compliance is enforced directly at the protocol level through:

- KYC attestation from authorized identity providers
- Treasury-managed attestor allowlists
- Transaction-layer denylists for sanctions and court orders

Wallets remain pseudonymous unless unmasked via legal process.

## 3. Monetary Policy via Staking

Token issuance and liquidity are governed by programmable rules:

- Staking yields are defined by curve parameters
- Supply expansion and contraction are algorithmic and visible
- Eliminates reliance on opaque banking reserves or repo operations

## 4. Multi-Token Support

The protocol allows multiple token authorities to issue native assets:

- Each token governed by its own monetary logic
- All tokens interoperable on a shared compliance and settlement layer
- Enables both government and private issuance

## 5. Public Ledger with Optional Privacy

Transactions are recorded on a public ledger:

- Supports automatic reporting and simplified auditability
- Allows selective disclosure through attestation chains
- Enables transparent taxation and spend tracking without intermediaries

## 6. QR-Cash (Physical Interoperability)

Physical cash integrates with the protocol via tamper-evident bearer notes:

- QR codes map to on-chain balances
- Treasury verifies authenticity in real time
- Offline operation enabled for disaster or rural scenarios

## 7. Savings and Loan Institutions Remain Relevant

Savings and loan institutions continue to serve a vital role:

- Offer synthetic account balances backed by customer deposits  
- Provide lending, payments, and portfolio services  
- Maintain internal withdrawal controls and risk management  
- Access protocol liquidity without minting or monetary authority  

## Key Design Principles

- **Direct custody:** Wallets are user-held; no intermediaries required.
- **Programmable compliance:** KYC, sanctions, and court orders enforced on-chain.
- **Transparent monetary logic:** All token issuance, staking, and liquidity rules are visible and deterministic.
- **Multi-signature governance:** Token authorities manage minting via multisig quorum.
- **Cash interoperability:** Physical QR notes integrate with digital balances.
- **Smart-contract-free:** Core operations are implemented without general-purpose contracts to maximize performance and auditability.

## Core Components

### Wallets and Attestations

- Wallets require attestation from identity providers.
- Attestors are approved and allowlisted by the U.S. Treasury (or analogous authority).
- Attestations are non-cryptographic legal records tying real-world identity to a wallet.

### Allowlist and Denylist

- Treasury maintains:
  - **Attestor allowlist**: which identity providers may issue attestations.
  - **Transaction denylist**: addresses or tokens restricted due to sanctions or court orders.
- Compliance checks are enforced at transaction level.

### Monetary Policy

- All tokens settle natively on-chain.
- Monetary policy for each token is defined by its issuer:
  - Staking-based yield curves control issuance and incentive structure.
  - No fractional reserves or synthetic credit creation required.

### Liquidity Provision

- Third parties pool currency pair assets, incentivized by fees.

### Physical QR Notes

- Physical cash issued by the Treasury includes embedded QR codes.
- Notes are tamper-evident and represent bearer access to a backing wallet.
- Online validation ensures authenticity; offline use supported via fixed value serialization.

## Capabilities

- **Full-stack replacement** of legacy dollar settlement infrastructure
- **Compliant support** for multiple tokens and issuing authorities
- **Transparent monetary logic** per token
- **Deterministic enforcement** of legal constraints
- **Offline-capable** bearer instruments
- **Open, audit-friendly ledger** with selective privacy

## Implementation Scope

This protocol does not include:

- General-purpose smart contract platforms
- Stablecoins backed by crypto collateral
- Volatility-prone DeFi mechanics
- Identity databases or centralized ledgers

## Intended Participants

- **Token Authorities**: Authorized to mint and govern token rules (e.g., central banks, treasuries, institutions)
- **Wallet Holders**: Individuals or organizations holding balances via attested wallets
- **Attestors**: Identity providers allowlisted by the Treasury
- **Validators**: Nodes that process transactions and enforce compliance
