# Token Authorities: Limits, Obligations, and Public Benefit

This document outlines the practical and regulatory constraints of operating a token authority in the Digital USD ecosystem. It clarifies why such roles are not profit-maximizing businesses, what oversight is required to prevent systemic abuse, and why governments should view this protocol as a reinforcement—not a threat—to economic stability.

## I. What a Token Authority Is (and Isn’t)

A token authority is a legal entity empowered to:

- Create (mint) new tokens of a specific type
- Destroy (burn) those tokens
- Define and adjust monetary policy for that token (e.g., issuance thresholds, yield parameters, and backing disclosures)

Token authorities **do not**:
- Control wallet denylisting (this is enforced via U.S. Treasury data)
- Operate validator nodes
- Interfere with other token ecosystems
- Earn fees from network activity

Token authorities are accountable to the legal and regulatory frameworks under which they operate. They must be attested entities with transparent disclosures of issuance rules, reserves (if applicable), and jurisdictional boundaries.

## II. Why Token Authorities Might Exist Anyway

Despite lacking profit potential, there are valid reasons an institution might choose to operate a token authority:

- **Monetary Coordination**  
  Central banks may issue tokens as part of monetary policy, especially if they require velocity controls or transparency unavailable in traditional channels.

- **Brand Utility**  
  Corporations may issue tokens to create tightly integrated ecosystems with consumers and suppliers, where monetary control is useful even without direct profit.

- **Asset Distribution**  
  Institutional actors may prefer tokens as programmable wrappers for distributions (e.g., subsidized credits, industrial incentives, or loyalty models).

- **Mission-Driven Experiments**  
  Some entities may participate for ideological, policy, or research reasons, testing alternative economic models or serving underbanked populations.

While not profit-seeking in the traditional sense, these use cases reflect **strategic, policy-aligned, or reputational** motives.

## III. Necessary Regulations and Disclosures

To prevent abuses such as circular collateral games or covert inflation, token authorities must meet baseline standards:

- **Disclosure of Backing**  
  If a token is claimed to be backed, full reserve composition and audit history must be made public.

- **No Tokens-Backed-by-Tokens**  
  Tokens used as backing for other tokens must not themselves be backed by tokens. This avoids recursive valuation bubbles and unstable dependency chains.

- **Limitations on Asset Tokenization**  
  Any real-world asset eligible for Fed purchase (e.g., Treasuries, MBSs) should not be tokenized on the settlement layer to prevent competition between the Fed and private currencies over asset demand.

- **Jurisdiction Disclosure**  
  Each token must indicate the jurisdiction in which its monetary policy is enforced and which legal authorities can intervene.

## IV. Why Governments Should Not Feel Threatened

This protocol does not remove regulatory power—it **enforces it more effectively**.

- **Protocol-Level Sanctions, KYC, and Auditability**  
  Compliance is built into the protocol layer, providing better enforcement and visibility than traditional financial systems.

- **No Shadow Banking**  
  While custodial wallets may still create synthetic balances, there is no way to obfuscate total system balances or engage in unregistered money creation.

- **Opt-in Adoption**  
  Users and institutions choose which tokens to accept and hold. If a central bank or government issues a credible token, it will likely dominate.

- **Global Stability via Transparent Competition**  
  Competing currencies exist today in the form of crypto assets and offshore banking. This system brings such activity into the light, allowing responsible governance, taxation, and oversight.

## V. Summary

Token authorities serve as programmable monetary policy agents—legal, bounded, and transparent. While they provide flexibility and competition, they are constrained by design to prevent the very abuses that have plagued fiat systems and crypto experiments alike.

Far from threatening state power, this system gives it sharper tools: compliance at the root, economic gravity as the check, and public verifiability as the enforcer.
